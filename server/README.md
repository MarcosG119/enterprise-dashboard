# Running Dashboard Backend

You will need to have two environment variables to run this locally. You need to create a mongodb database and user and set MONGO_URL to that url with the password. You can also set PORT=5001 to be able to use default settings.

### `npm install`

This will install all the necessary packages to run the server

### `npm run start`

This will start your server at http://localhost:5001.
